# movie-app

The app enables users to search for movies and tv series.
I use https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api for getting information about movies and series.
//The response is the searched data with trailers for the inputted search query and page
The endpoint `/api/movies` is multi search that supports searching for movies and tv shows in a single request.

# start the app

npm install
